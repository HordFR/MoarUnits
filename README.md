## Installation Instructions

1. Unzip the zip file.
2. The contents of the MOAR_Units subdirectory should be copied into your Mods folder (.../Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/).
3. The contents of the MOAR_Units_Assets subdirectory should be copied into your Civ VI game root directory (e.g. .../steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization VI) overwriting any existing files to add the new art references. You should probably backup these files first - use at your own risk! This is only necessary since we don't know how to release modified artdef files in mods yet - once we do it should be possible to repackage this as a proper mod.
4. Enable enable Moar Units via the checkbox under Additional Content.

If you don't see the new art assets in the game then you probably haven't copied the files from MOAR_Units_Assets correctly. The files that need to be in place within the game directory for the current version of Moar Units are:

../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/Civ6.dep (overwrite)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/ArtDefs/Units.artdef(overwrite)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/ArtDefs/Units_Moar.artdef(new)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/Assets/UI/Icons/Icons_Units.xml (overwrite)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/Assets/UI/Icons/Icons_UnitPortraits.xml (overwrite)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/Assets/UI/Icons/Icons_UnitFlags.xml (overwrite)
../Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Base/Assets/Text/en_US/MOAR_Units_GameplayText.xml (new)

## Known Issues
Due to the current incompleteness of mod support you will need to restart the game between each new game or reloaded savegame for game text to display correctly.

## Re-Use in Other Mods
I'm happy for anything from Moar Units to be re-used and reworked in other mods. Go ahead!

Have fun!
